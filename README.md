Udacity Blockchain Developer Nanodegree Program Projects

### [Project 1 - Create Your Own Private Blockchain](https://github.com/NeziheSozen/Udacity-Blockchain-Developer-Create-Your-Own-Private-Blockchain)

The project covers topics such as creating a genesis block, adding new blocks to the chain, implementing proof of work consensus algorithm, and handling errors and validations. 

We also gain experience using APIs to interact with their blockchain and testing their code using Postman. By the end of the project, we have a functioning private blockchain that can securely store and transfer data, and the knowledge to expand upon their blockchain development skills.

### [Project 2 - Build CryptoStar Dapp on Ethereum](https://github.com/NeziheSozen/Udacity-Blockchain-Developer-Build-CryptoStar-DApp-on-Ethereum)

The Build CryptoStar Dapp on Ethereum project offered by Udacity guides we through the development of a decentralized application (Dapp) using the Ethereum blockchain platform. The project covers topics such as smart contract development using Solidity, deploying the contract on the Rinkeby test network, and building a user interface using web3.js and HTML/CSS. 

We learn how to use the OpenZeppelin library for secure contract development and implement functionality for users to claim and trade their own unique stars using the ERC-721 token standard. By the end of the project, we have a working Dapp that demonstrates their understanding of Ethereum development and the potential for blockchain technology in creating decentralized applications.
